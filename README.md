# Inception-E
In this repository I share the proposed method for GoogLeNet replacing the convolutional layers and allowing the network to work with variable size of inputs

This paper is an brief analysis of the paper "Going deeper with convolutions" that result in the first version of Inception model, furthermore create a variant of the
original model replacing the convolutions of 5x5 with two of 3x3 including an option to the model accept inputs of variable size.

Lastly was performed benchmarks for the task of classification over the CIFAR10 dataset to evaluate the accuracies, three models were considered: Inception-Customized, VGG19 and ResNet18.
